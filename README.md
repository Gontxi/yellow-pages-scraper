# yellow-pages-scraper

This script uses simple_html_dom to parse yellow pages business information.

The current setup pulls business name, address, and telephone number. 

Install these folders into desired directory on your server. Visit the index.php page and simple input 
the keywords you would like to search for as well as the city and state.

Right now this script will run through the pages and download a csv file neatly formatted with the results.

I have included the neccessary files to insert the results into a database, but those scripts are still under construction.

If you run the search often, your IP address will end up being blocked.

I have to suggest that you only use this script for personal use, using this script in order to 
monetize on the results may be in violation of the terms of use of yellowpages.com.

I hope you enjoy this program, please let me know if you have any questions comments or concerns.
